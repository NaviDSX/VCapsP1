## Task Part One:
### As a part of the CAPSTONE project you need to explain missing:
- We take the encoded image (dxH/32xW/32) and send it to Multi-Head Attention 
    - **A.(FROM WHERE DO WE TAKE THIS ENCODED IMAGE?)**
- We also send dxN Box embeddings to the Multi-Head Attention
- We do something here to generate NxMxH/32xW/32 maps. 
    - **B.(WHAT DO WE DO HERE?)**
- Then we concatenate these maps with Res5 Block 
    - **C.(WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM?)**
  <img src="./arch.png" width="720" >
- Then we perform the above steps 
    - **D.(EXPLAIN THESE STEPS)**
- And then we are finally left with the panoptic segmentation
